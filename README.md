# Current state

*Warning* This code base has been extracted from the online-go.com source code
where it was highly integrated and minimally touched for many years even during
some moderinization of the rest of the site. Until v 1.0 is released of this
library, it is not recommended to make use of it as much overhaul is happening
to improve usability on sites other than online-go.com.
